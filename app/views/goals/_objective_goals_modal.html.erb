<p><b>Objective Goals</b> - These goals are all about accomplishing an objective.  Examples include: making the varsity team, go to the state championship tournament, or playing your sport at the college level.  These goals are inspirational goals, but they tend to be very difficult to track progress towards, and therefor very difficult to generate action from day-to-day.  Anytime you create an objective goal, there should be at least one process goal that is tied to it that will drive your day-to-day actions to accomplishing this goal.</p>

<p><b>Performance Goals</b> - These goals are focused on improving performance, but only by measuring, not by doing.  Examples include: decreasing your time on the 40yd dash by .2 seconds or benchpressing your body weight. These goals are more actionable than objective goals, but they are still outcome based.  The element that is still required is the "what".  Specifically, what you are going to do to achieve this performance improvement in a given amount of time.  Just like objective goals, anytime you create a performance goal, there should be at least one process goal that is tied to it that will drive your day-to-day actions to accomplishing this goal.</p>

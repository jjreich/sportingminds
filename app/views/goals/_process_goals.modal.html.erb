<p><b>Process Goals</b> - These goals are by definition action driven.  They define what you intend to do to accomlish your bigger performance and objective goals.  For example, if you have a performance goal of being able to juggle a soccer ball 100 times in a row, without the ball touching the ground within 2 months, you may set up a process goal of doing dedicated juggling practice for at least 10 minutes per day, 6 days/week.</p>
